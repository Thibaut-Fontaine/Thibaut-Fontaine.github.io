								<h2 style="color:#f9ebcd;">About - The Eleusinian Mysteries</h2>
								<p>For over 2000 years of human history, near Athens, Greece, a cultural practice was held, to commune with death, to honour the path of life and to die before you die. It was known as the Eleusinian Mysteries and most of Greece and Rome’s top philosophers, poets and leaders were initiates- it is widely believed that Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pericles, Cicero, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius experienced the Mysteries- however, slaves and children were also initiated.

									Based around the story of Persephone’s abduction by Hades and her mother Demeter’s wild search to bring her back to the land of the living, the Mysteries honour the cycle of life and death, the wondrous unknowing of the afterlife. 
									
									“Happy are those among mortals who have seen these mysteries; but whoever is uninitiate, will never have the same (good) fortune once in the darkness of Hades.”
									
									We don’t know much- reverence for the Mysteries compelled initiates to observe the mandatory law of silence about what happened in the Telesterion and so testimonies over those 2,000 years are scant, but we know some things. Initiates were guaranteed happiness in the afterlife and the initiations were physically, mentally and emotionally demanding. They involved mind-altering substances, performances and revelations. People emerged with a profound sense of peace.

								<h2>About - modern grief
								</h2>
								<p>Isolated as we are in our boxes, in our cities, in our cultures and conventions, we have lost connection with the ebb to the flow. Loss through death (even the thought of it) can be an agonising experience for anyone, and there is little comprehension in our modern world for how to process our grief and what support to give those grieving. People tend to shy away at the very mention of death, so toxic and threatening is it to our fragile egoic world.

									Death doulas go some way to ease the transition from life to death. With a deeply graceful role to play, they support the dying one, their support network and dependents. Just like doulas helping to fulfil our responsibility when bringing new consciousness into the world, death doulas are there at the end, calm and coherent.
									
									We are divorced from the awesome wonder that is our consciousness. We must heal our relationship with death, Yin, the moon, the ebb, winter. By facing your own death, and the death of everything and everyone you know, you will be forced to surrender to forces greater than all of humanity, forces that will make you succumb. You can kick and scream or you can open your heart.

								<h2>About - The Reveries
								</h2>
								<p>The great Eleusinian Mysteries were ransacked and dismantled when pagan practices were outlawed and Europe moved into a Christian-medieval period. The sacred objects will likely never be known, libations and incantations cause vibrations worlds away now, and the deep care taken over precisely hewn stones has been worn away, even as I sat in the cave to the underworld in 2024 watching the rain hammer down over the site.

									What we are left with is a sense of awe and wonder. Shadows of the annual pilgrimage of five thousand souls who spent a day walking from Athens, starved themselves, stayed up at night, to prostrate themselves before the gods, to change their relationship with death forever. Carefully collected testimonials and a beautiful upgrade to the site and museum after Elefsina (the modern Greek port town built around the site of the Mysteries) was host to the European City of Culture 2023, piece together a basic understanding of the journey of initiates.
									
									The Reveries is based on that. By following the lightly marked path into oblivion, and exploring how the modern world provides us with tools to guide us and curate our journey, we explore the deepest recess of what it means to be human and to lose everything.

								<h2>About - Leila
									<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I entered the Telesterion and stood alone inside, imagining the ruin as a dark hall with five thousand people crowded in. I imagined the sweat, the fear, the anticipation, the sheer humanity, the ecstasis. The heart-opening moment of shared experience, then CRACK, I was brought back to 2024 as a thunderclap shot through the air like a whip, out of nowhere, directly above my head; the storm was miles away. Alarms from cars parked around the perimeter responded to nature’s flex, and my heart was pounding, the sour taste of adrenaline on my tongue. Where five thousand people for two thousand years had died before death, I was alone and awed.

									The deluge began just as I closed my eyes to connect with death in the entrance to the Underworld, as the Greek witch had told me to do the previous day. The storm, now overhead, roiled around the sky, circling my cave like a vulture, caging me with a torrential downpour and lightning strikes that I could see across the low site. I was alone, and though I saw and heard the modern world outside the gates, I was held safely in the ancient sureness of Pluto, Hades, Death. I surrendered to my fate. The fate of everything. Oblivion. As Zeus cracked the sky open above me and aeons of meaning poured out.
									
									I’ve been close to death, of others, and namely my own, wished upon myself in a dispassionate way over several years. I’m not special, or different because of this. That day I made a deal with Hades, that if I wasn’t struck down by lightning as I crossed out of the site after the rain, I would start a death work practise. I crossed, the burrs in my soles, annoying before, gave me grip. Outside, I found sunflowers for a sick friend, and as I drove to the airport, a deeply golden sky shone ahead of me. The ebb and the flow. I was alive and joyful to be. With a new purpose, to try to help heal our broken and toxic relationship with death.
